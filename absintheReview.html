These cards by Ellusionist are simply fantastic. The handling is suberb and they spring like they are real magic.
But, put aside handling and we have one of the most beautiful and unique deck of cards. The back design is extremely
intricate and detailed and the front of the cards is just simply beautiful. Only complaint: Comes with an absinthe recipe card instead of double-backer.
Get out and buy this fantastic deck of cards.
